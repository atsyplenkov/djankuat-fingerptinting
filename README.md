# Djankuat river (Caucasus Mountains) sediment source fingerprinting

This repository centralizes the main processing steps to explore sediment dynamics after exceptional erosion event. It is meant to accompany a journal article ([*Tsyplenkov et al., 2021*](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.catena.2021.105285)). This study is part of the ongoing Russian Science Foundation project No. 19-17-00181: *«Quantitative assessment of the slope sediment flux and its changes in the Holocene for the Caucasus mountain rivers.»*
